This game was created to practice concepts of programming and logic. In it we have 2 game modes:  
* <b>Player vs Player</b>: you and a friend can play against each other using the same cell phone  
* <b>Player vs computer</b>: you can play against the computer that will make random moves  
  

<b>Keep calm!</b> In two game modes you will have a scoreboard to see how you are doing and a menu to play again or exit the game:
